# Assignment 1 — CodeTrack: Initial Git Setup (Local Only)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will set up Git correctly on your local machine before starting the CodeTrack project. You will create a local repository and configure your Git identity at both the repository level (local) and the machine level (global). This assignment is local only — you will not push anything to GitHub yet.

---

# Task 1 — Create the CodeTrack Project and Initialize Git

## Goal

Create a `CodeTrack` project folder and initialize it as a Git repository.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git init` inside `CodeTrack` showing "Initialized empty Git repository"

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `ls -a` showing the `.git` folder

### Notes

**1. What is the `.git` folder, and why does it matter?**

The .git folder is a hidden folder that Git creates when you run git init. It's where Git keeps everything about the project's history, including all the commits, branches, the staging area and the repository's local settings.

It matters because it's what turns an ordinary folder into a Git repository. Without it, there's no version control at all. If you delete it, you lose the entire history, even though your current files stay put. It's hidden because you're not meant to edit it by hand; Git manages it for ourself.

# Task 2 — Configure Git Identity Locally (Repository-Only)

## Goal

Set your Git username and email for the `CodeTrack` repository only, using `git config --local`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config --local --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

# Task 3 — Configure Git Identity Globally

## Goal

Set a global Git username and email for this machine using `git config --global`. Note that CodeTrack's local settings still take priority over these.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git config --global --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

# Task 4 — Share Your Git Setup Progress

## Goal

Share your Git setup progress on WhatsApp Status, including your generated DMI leaderboard progress link.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Published WhatsApp Status showing your Git setup message and leaderboard progress link
